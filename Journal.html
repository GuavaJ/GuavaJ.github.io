    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>I think a major technical challege for my team at this momment is the scope of responsibilities. Due to having a small group, I think some individuals may need to have more than one role. What makes this challenge more prominent, is the current lack of communication. I have never interacted with one of my teammates and haven't been able to contact them. In order to solve this challenge, I will email my teammate and hopefully recieve an answer. By gaining that communication with them, it will be easy to define the roles and tasks of each individual.

    <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Although the project has just started, I believe it is imperative to have a gantt chart. Every member in my team has a different school schedule and have privilege periods at different times. This makes it harder to define when everyone is available and unrestricted to other commitments. With the help of a gantt chart and a social networking platform such as slack, could help my team and I understand when each of us is available and in the future, keep us on track in finishing the project. 
    </p>

    <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm having a dispute with one of my teamates regarding materials and efficiency. My teammate and I are both adamant on our opinions of the best option. Due to our persistance, I believe the best solution would be to gain the point of view of another teammate. Similar to the technical challenge above, this stems from the lack of communication with another teammate. I think after gaining their contact infromation, it will be easier to resolve our disagreement.

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <h3>(Software) Development Engineer</h3>
    <p>The role of the "Development Engineer" is designing, creating and testing new products for the companies. The role of the back-end developmental engineer is to make sure that the code is efficient, stable, and works as intended. They also have the job of making sure that the system is secure and can't be back doored. The role of front-end developmental engineer is to make the user-facing part of the application. I believe I would be a good fit in this role as I enjoy finding new way to display content to the user. By being a software engineer, I will learn innovative ways to improve the product and help it stand out from other competitors in the market. However, I may not fit in this role as I'm not currently confident in writing efficient and reusable code.</p>
    <h3>QA Engineer</h3>
    <p>A QA Engineer tests the products to find any bugs or errors in the product. They ensure that the product is good for the customer and to make sure that the specifications are adhered to by the product. I believe I would be a good fit in this role as I have work experience working with customers and finding out what they need. However, I also believe that I may not fit in this role as finding minute errors in code may prove challenging. In order to be successful in this role, I need to become more attentive to small details.  </p>
    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <p>The project manager oversees the whole project, makes a time table and makes sure everyone is on track, meeting the proper deadlines. The project manager also monitors the group, solves any issues that arise, evaluates project performance and leads the team. I believe that I would be a good fit in this role because I have led a youth debate club before. I understand the significance of completing all tasks in the duration given. However, I also believe that may not fit in this role as I sometimes tend to procastinate. In order to be successful in this role, I need to adhere to time constraints and goals.</p>
    <h3>Product Manager</h3>
    <p>The product manager oversees product development and building. They balance time and other constraints with feature set, and provides support to ensure that all other members are meeting requirements. In addition to this they manage interactions between different components of the product, e.g. UI/UX, QA, and Development. I believe I would be a good fit in this role as explained above for the project manager role. Leading many young-adults and organizing events at the temple taught be to be proactive when my actions have many dependants. This can also be my downfall due to my laziness. </p>
    <h3>Release Engineer</h3>
    <p>The release engineer plans release lifecycle, manage risk for release scope,and monitor progress.I don't believe I will be a good fit for this role. This role's importance supercedes many of the other ones. Having a good understanding on the software delivery life cycle and coordinating the launch/update of numerous components of the application at once is very daunting. In order to better fit this role, I would have to atain a grasp on constraints and goals to increase judgment on launching.</p>
