   <h1>CS-III Journal: Week of 04/25/23</h1>
	  <h2>Plans for the Week</h2>
   <p>Today, my team and I had an important meeting to discuss the progress of our ISP project. We realized that we had a lack of progress last week, which put us under a larger time restraint since AP exams are next week. As a result, we had to prioritize our tasks and focus on the most important ones that can be completed within the given timeframe.

One of the challenges we faced was identifying the root cause of the lack of progress. However, with the help of my team, we were able to identify the issue and develop a plan to overcome it. We also had to reorganize our Gantt chart to reflect the changes in our project's timeline.

During the meeting, we also discussed updates and improvements to our product, which is similar to the product dot card. We came up with some great ideas to enhance the product's functionality and user experience, such as integrating additional social media platforms and improving the overall design.

Overall, I feel confident that my team and I can overcome the challenges we face and complete the project successfully. It is essential that we continue to communicate effectively and work together to achieve our goals. I'm excited to see the final outcome of our project and to present it to our classmates and instructors.

    <h1>CS-II Jouranl: Week of 04/17/23</h1>
    <p>Moving on to the tasks that need to be accomplished this week, it's essential to prioritize the tasks that are critical to the success of the project. One of the primary tasks would be to test the functionality of the NFC chips and ensure that they are working correctly. Additionally, it would be important to finalize the design of the metal cards and ensure that they are aesthetically pleasing while also being durable and long-lasting.</h2>

     <p> In terms of acknowledging past issues related to UI and team chemistry, it's crucial to learn from our mistakes and use them as opportunities for growth and improvement. It's essential to have open and honest communication within the team, where everyone's input is valued and heard. This will help to foster a positive and collaborative team environment, where everyone is working towards the same goals.</h2>

     <p> Overall, it's important to stay focused, motivated and work together as a team to achieve the project's objectives. By doing so, you can create a successful project that not only meets the requirements but also exceeds expectations, providing an innovative solution that can benefit many people in the future.</h2>

    <h2> Technical CHallenges</h2>
    <p>I think a major technical challege for my team at this momment is the scope of responsibilities. Due to having a small group, I think some individuals may need to have more than one role. What makes this challenge more prominent, is the current lack of communication. I have never interacted with one of my teammates and haven't been able to contact them. In order to solve this challenge, I will email my teammate and hopefully recieve an answer. By gaining that communication with them, it will be easy to define the roles and tasks of each individual.
    </p>

    <h2> Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p>Although the project has just started, I believe it is imperative to have a gantt chart. Every member in my team has a different school schedule and have privilege periods at different times. This makes it harder to define when everyone is available and unrestricted to other commitments. With the help of a gantt chart and a social networking platform such as slack, could help my team and I understand when each of us is available and in the future, keep us on track in finishing the project.
    </p>

    <h2> Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I'm having a dispute with one of my teamates regarding materials and efficiency. My teammate and I are both adamant on our opinions of the best option. Due to our persistance, I believe the best solution would be to gain the point of view of another teammate. Similar to the technical challenge above, this stems from the lack of communication with another teammate. I think after gaining their contact infromation, it will be easier to resolve our disagreement.

    <h2>Techincal Challenges</h2>
    <p>The nfc chips are trash. They are very finicky. Sometimes they dont stick and the other times they simply dont work. I believe it is imperitive that we must get a new set of nfc chips. 
    </p>

    <h2> Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p>As stated in the previous week, we are very behind. However, it is quite an easy project so I beieve not a lot of additional effort needs to be put in. Being behind is the new on time. 
    </p>

    <h2> Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of my teammates  continues to use racial slurs such as monkey and baboon. I have been affected mentally with their actions.

    <p> Date: 13-Mar-2023</p>

    <h2> Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p>We are having problems with the nfc chips. We are having a hard time finding a platfrom to code the chips on. All the platforms aren't very user frienldy and it is like the UI was designed and valued with the eyes of Boden.
    </p>

    <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p>With the increase in tests, we have fallen quite behind. I believe we need to update our gnatt chart. 
    </p>

    <h2> Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p>We have srecieved a response from our third memeber. However, he hasnt put any issues or tried to contanct us again.

    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p> We still haven't ordered the material needed to make a base prototype. In addition to this, for these materials we haven't finalized the optimal choices and the cost effectivness of everything. I believe in order to overcome this challenge the team must meet up and discuss this matter as it decides the rest of the course of this project. </p>

    <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p> Two teammates in the group have yet to communicate with the third member.  In order to make progress we must set communcation with them. We also have to find a time to set a release date.</p>

    <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p> Another teamate and I got into a confrontation. He refused to give me a piece of gum on the day of my birthday. His lack of empahty and bonding towards me make me not want to work with him. </p>

    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <p> Our team is debating in how to make a user application that will make it easier for consumers to utilize the product. Assuming that people change over time, people may want to update the information of their digital business card. While we want to make such a feature, we don't believe we have the necessary resources. The lack of team members and lack of time makes this a challenge that needs to be adressed promptly. </p>

    <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <p> The team still hasn't sat together and decided when to actively start. The lack of team coordination make this very hard. </p>

    <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <p> As adressed in scheduling challenges, I still havent been able to communication with one of my team memmbers. I have done my part to try to reach out, however I have yet to hear back from them. </p>

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <h3>(Software) Development Engineer</h3>
    <p>The role of the "Development Engineer" is designing, creating and testing new products for the companies. The role of the back-end developmental engineer is to make sure that the code is efficient, stable, and works as intended. They also have the job of making sure that the system is secure and can't be back doored. The role of front-end developmental engineer is to make the user-facing part of the application. I believe I would be a good fit in this role as I enjoy finding new way to display content to the user. By being a software engineer, I will learn innovative ways to improve the product and help it stand out from other competitors in the market. However, I may not fit in this role as I'm not currently confident in writing efficient and reusable code.</p>
    <h3>QA Engineer</h3>
    <p>A QA Engineer tests the products to find any bugs or errors in the product. They ensure that the product is good for the customer and to make sure that the specifications are adhered to by the product. I believe I would be a good fit in this role as I have work experience working with customers and finding out what they need. However, I also believe that I may not fit in this role as finding minute errors in code may prove challenging. In order to be successful in this role, I need to become more attentive to small details.  </p>
    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <p>The project manager oversees the whole project, makes a time table and makes sure everyone is on track, meeting the proper deadlines. The project manager also monitors the group, solves any issues that arise, evaluates project performance and leads the team. I believe that I would be a good fit in this role because I have led a youth debate club before. I understand the significance of completing all tasks in the duration given. However, I also believe that may not fit in this role as I sometimes tend to procastinate. In order to be successful in this role, I need to adhere to time constraints and goals.</p>
    <h3>Product Manager</h3>
    <p>The product manager oversees product development and building. They balance time and other constraints with feature set, and provides support to ensure that all other members are meeting requirements. In addition to this they manage interactions between different components of the product, e.g. UI/UX, QA, and Development. I believe I would be a good fit in this role as explained above for the project manager role. Leading many young-adults and organizing events at the temple taught be to be proactive when my actions have many dependants. This can also be my downfall due to my laziness. </p>
    <h3>Release Engineer</h3>
    <p>The release engineer plans release lifecycle, manage risk for release scope,and monitor progress.I don't believe I will be a good fit for this role. This role's importance supercedes many of the other ones. Having a good understanding on the software delivery life cycle and coordinating the launch/update of numerous components of the application at once is very daunting. In order to better fit this role, I would have to atain a grasp on constraints and goals to increase judgment on launching.</p>
