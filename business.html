    <h1>Identity</h1>
    <p>
    Project: Eagle Card  
    </p>

    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>
      Professionals such as lawyers, doctors, and businessmen, have to buy business cards that can become an unforseen costly expense. The cost for bulks of paper cards can start at a whopping 20 bucks. That is expensive. Imagine all the mcdonalds you could get. My team and I, plan to take social and business interaction to the next level. 
    </p>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>
      With the help of NFC or RFID, we will tackle this problem. Our solution is a minilamistic metal card with the ability to send one's information (ex: Digital portfolio, socials, etc.) to another person's device. Similar to how apple pay works, our seemless idea will bring forth a new innovation that is cost effective and a life-long solution.  
    </p>

    <h1>Target and Market</h1>
    <p>
      Our target is everyone between ages of 18-65. Adults today, have some sort of digital footprint whether it is through social media or other platfroms. Our product would be usefull for everyone in that age range. 
    </p>


    <h1>Competition</h1>
    <p>
      Our biggest competiton are companies such as vistaprint and other big business card makers. It will be challenging to push our product's idea against a traditional and successful company. 
    </p>

    <h1>Revenue and Streams</h1>
    <p>
      Eagle card will sell directly to consumers from an online page as well as amazon. Our page will provide a customization tool to make each card unique and personal to the beholder. 
    </p>

    <h1>Marketing and Activities</h1>
    <p>
      To market our idea, we will use our teachers. For local marketing we will put posters of our products outside or in our classes. In addition to this, we may use Instagram and Tiktok as they are the most popular social media platforms.
    </p>


    <h1>Expenses</h1>
    <p>
      Rfid chips - $18
      Stailess Steel Metal Cards - $10
    </p>

    <h1>Team and Key Roles</h1>
    <p>
      Project Manager - Gaurav Jha
      Employee of the month - Aryan Kulkarni
    </p>

    <h1>Milestones</h1>
    <p>
      The first milestone would be making our first card. Since it would be our first product, we will definately face challenges. Our second milestone would be the development of our online store and introduction of our product on amazon.
