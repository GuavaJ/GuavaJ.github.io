      During my Junior year of High School, I was in Computer Science II. My group had based our ISP
      on a problem with a trend of that time. Instead of playing classical phone games such as Clash
      Royale and Solitare, people were playing wordle and mathle. However as my group and I played
      more mathle, we reached the conclusion that mathle was becoming boring and redundant. The big
      concept of the prject was to generate a random equation that would be applicable for people to
      guess. We needed to set some parameters first. We needed numbers with either 1 or 2 digits.
      When numbers hit 3 digits, calculations can become too tedious. For example, 365 x 252.
      Doesn't sound very fun. Another thing we had to make note of was PEMDAS. It needed to follow
      the order of operations if numerous operands were involved. Although we ruled out triple digit
      numbers, we wanted to give some control of difficulty to the user. Thats why we made it infinitly
      expandable. In order to keep things simple, we also set a restriction to only let the end number
      be positive integer. The applications and software we used was vscode as well as java. One important
      interesting point about my team's isp, was controlling probability. We made it less likely to get
      high numbers and selected numbers less likely to appear again in the same equation.
