    <h2> Quotes </h2>
    <p>
      1) "Let us not reason like cowards,’ said Okonkwo. ‘If a man comes into my hut and defecates on the floor, what do I do? Do I shut my eyes? No! I take a stick and break his head. That is what a man does."
    </p>
    <p>
      2) "And at last the locusts did descend. They settled on every tree and on every blade of grass; they settled on the roofs and covered the bare ground. Mighty tree branches broke away under them, and the whole country became the brown-earth color of the vast, hungry swarm."
    </p>
    <p>
      3) "Okonkwo was popularly called the “Roaring Flame.” As he looked into the log fire he recalled the name. He was a flaming fire. How then could he have begotten a son like Nwoye, degenerate and effeminate?"
    </p> 
    <p>
      4) "He heard Ikemefuna cry, “My father, they have killed me!” as he ran towards him. Dazed with fear, Okonkwo drew his machete and cut him down. He was afraid of being thought weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      5) "And indeed he was possessed by the fear of his father’s contemptible life and shameful death."
    </p>
    
    <h2>Theme</h2>
    <p>One major theme in the novel is pride. Throughout the novel, Okonkwo trys to build his status in society and maintain personal pride in his success. He does this trough many different actions. One way he builds pride is through growing yams. Yams represent masculinity which is very important to Okonkwo. Another way he builds his pride is through becoming an Egwugwu. Egwugwu are respected and becomeing one means you are a respected man in the village.
