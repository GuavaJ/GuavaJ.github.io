   Hi! My name is Gaurav Jha. I am currently a high school student at Allen High School
   pursuing the Computer Science pathway. My teacher for 3 years Mr.Ben-yaakov is the
   most influential teacher I have ever had. I like having fun with what I do and try
   my best to be creative in everything. I have learned Python and hopefully will continue
   to expand my knowledge in many languages.
