  <h1>Welcome to Gaurav's Digital Portfolio!</h1>
  

    <p>
 Welcome to my digital protfolio! A digital portfolio is important because it is a great tool
 that can display growth over time and present it in a professional manner. Despite making this
 in high school, this will stay with me for a lifetime. It can be used as a resource in the future
 and even utilize it as a resume. Companies will want to see my skillset and factors beyond my GPA, SAT,
 etc. Unlike many projects done in school, a portfolio as such will aid me continously throught out my
 adult life. I hope you have a great time traversing mine!
