    <h1><a href='https://codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html'>Akshay Vemulapalli's Proposal</a></h1> 
    <p>
      I considered Akshay's proposal because it is a very innovative idea. The use of artifical intelligence to detect user's drowsiness seemed like a very unique idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal because this idea had been patented by <a href='https://github.com/Vivek-Maranganti'>Vivek Maranganti</a> and a few of his friends. Although I would have loved to have worked on this project, it would take time for him to contact those acquaintances and recieve their consent to continue with the project.
      </p>

    <h1><a href='https://codermerlin.com/users/cameron-farley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html'>Cameron Farley's Proposal</a></h1>
    <p>
      I considered Cameron's proposal because the project is very interesting. As a high-school student, I encounted the redundant task of saying "here" in every class. With this idea, it would automatically do attendance with the use of facial recognition. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal because it has numerous problems. While this may make it easier for the teachers and substitutes, it may make students wary. Student may not want to be scanned especially with the current stigma around digital surveillance.
      <h1>Adheesh Katru's Proposal</h1>
    <p>
      I considered Adheesh's proposal of an automated plantation. It would replace the current produce and its distribution. Instead of focusing of the increase in gross profit by adding chemicals into produce, sourcing from organic and local farms would be benefical for the health of the entire country. 
    </p>
    <p>I decided to reject this proposal because of the problem of integrating it within current grocery markets. It will be difficult to ask consumers to pay more from a new source rather than brands such as Driscoll. 
      </p>
    <h1> Danelle Corbita's Proposal
    </h1>
    <p>
      I considered this proposal because I thought I could implement this into my lifestyle. Many students burn-out and even get "senior-itis" at an earlier age. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I decided to reject this proposal as there are many ways to perform the tasks the application is expected to do. Things such as excel, apple's reminder, and etc can all be used to bring order into life. 
      </p>

    <h1>Faraz Piracha's Proposal</h1>
    <p>
      I considered Faraz's proposal as it was very interesting. Akin to websites such as coolmath, they will provide games to stimuate the brain and earn money through advertisments. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal as it was very similar to what I had done last year. I had made a mathle game which were math puzzle games. The only addition to this project would be a platform for numerous games such as that. 
    <h1>Varun Natarajan's Proposal
    </h1>
    <p>
      I had considered this proposal because it tackles a problem I face many times when with friends. Unable to decide where to go for this such as food end up wasting a lot of time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal because it may cause concerns with privacy. Many may not want to share their location, which is crucial for the functioning of this application. 
      </p>

    <h1>Gautam Narayan's Proposal
    </h1>
    <p>
      I had considered Gautam proposal because I'm very interested in the stock market. I believe the idea of having a notification alert on recommended trades would increase confidence in consumer's decisions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal because consumers may question the integrity of the recommendations. The recommendations are based on a reddit page which may not be as looked greatly upon as is a investment advisor. 

    <h1>Shariq Hasan's Proposal
    </h1>
    <p>
      I had considered Shariq's proposal as I'm an avid spotify user. A group listening party would a cool thing to try in places such as classrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal because spotify already has a pre-built-in function similar to the proposal. Two premium users can sync up their music. 

    <h1>Drew Eldridge's Proposal
    </h1>
    <p>
      I had considered Drew's proposal as privacy is very important. His idea would use facial recognition which is a new blooming area I would like to explore. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to reject this proposal because it may cause some problems for people such as parents. While I believe privacy is important, I believe there is a certain expent that it may pertain to. 
      <h1>
	Darsh Radadia's Proposal 
    </h1>
    <p>
      I had considered Darsh's proposal because it would perform a very important function. Evaluating and placing users in the current job-market and field that would best fit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I decided to reject this proposal because I found it redundant. Indeed already does what this project would accomplish and already has a well-established userbase. 

    <h1>My Proposal 
    </h1>
    <p>
      With my thorough evaluation of numerous proposals, I decided to stick to my proposal of the eagle card. I believe that it best fits my current capabilities as it is not too easy nor too challenging that I will be contiuously in need.
