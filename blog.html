      I believe that it is imperative that government should regulated AI closely. Due to there new presence, it is very scary at the possible risks that may arise. Although some AI developers claim their AI are completely safe, recently there are have been new "experiments that proove that AI is still a new concept. Things such as prompt engineering can pose threats to currently laws already in place. People using applications such as Chatgpt may reword promts in certain ways that may cause for some reason of concern. If a user words prompts to ask for illegal firearms in a certain way, chatgpt reply with ways to acquire them. These illegal activities still need to be considered under governemnt juridtriciton before it is completely fool proof.
